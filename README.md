# Interactive Model Cards

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02894) (**Accepted at ACM Facct'22**)

This is an experimental project that examines whether interactivity can augment people's understanding of machine learning models. We build upon the model card work initially introduced by [Mitchell et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) and strategically add (and evaluated) interactivity through a human centered design process.
