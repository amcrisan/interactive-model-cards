This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts using the BERT base model. This way, the model learns the same inner representation of the English language than its teacher model, while being faster for inference or downstream tasks."
